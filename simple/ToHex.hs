-- Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

-- Note:

-- All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
-- The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
-- The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
-- You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
