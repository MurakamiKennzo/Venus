-- Say you have an array for which the i-thÂ element is the price of a given stock on day i.

-- Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

-- Note:
-- You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
