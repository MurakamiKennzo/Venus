-- Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

-- Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

-- Note:Â You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
