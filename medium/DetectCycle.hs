-- Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

-- To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed)Â in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

-- Note: Do not modify the linked list.
